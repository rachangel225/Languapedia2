    <p> 1. Chūnjié<br> <h2>春节</h2></p>
    <p class="description">Chinese New Year: Chinese New Year, is celebrated on the first day of the Lunar calender, which is usually between the end of January and the end of February. The tradition dates back 4000 years, and consists of large family gatherings with many different types of food, especially rice cakes and dumplings. You will often see firecrackers, lion dancing, the hanging of lanterns, money given in red envelopes, and many paper decorations being put up around each home for good fortune. Red is the main color for the festival, as it symbolizes happiness and good luck. The spring festivities usually start on New Years Eve and continues for 15 days, ending with the Lantern Festival. </p>

      <p class="description"> Lantern Festival: The Lantern Festival is celebrated on the 15th day of the Lunar calendar, and marks the last day of the Chinese New Year celebrations. Celebrated during the first full moon of the year, the most significant part of this holiday is eating “元宵”, or moon cakes. Its 2000 years of history also includes eating sticky rice, hanging lanterns (especially flower lanterns), lantern riddles, lion dances, dragon dances, etc. <br><br><br><img class="column6" src=https://res.cloudinary.com/mommy-nearest/image/upload/c_fill,h_450,w_800/j38895ffiezn6hdpixtp.jpg>

        <p>Qīngmíng jié <br><h2>清明节</h2></p>
        <p class="description"> Tomb-Sweeping Day: The Qing Ming festival, or Tomb-sweeping Day, falls around April 4 or 5th. On this day, people visit the cemetery of their ancestors or fallen soldiers to show respect, often by cleaning the tomb (removing weeds and adding new soil), praying, and presenting offerings such as the deceased person’s favorite food or paper that represents money. These offerings are burned in hope that the deceased person will receive them, wherever they are. Since the Tomb-Sweeping Day is during the prime time of spring, flying kites and going on hikes are also popular customs. <br><br><img class = "column5" src=http://s15.sinaimg.cn/mw690/001nItDMzy6RbsRYO7Ace&690>

          <p>4.Duānwǔ jié<br><h2> 端午节 </h2></p>
          <p class="description"> Dragon Boat Festival: The Dragon Boat Festival is celebrated on June 7th. It was originally created over 2000 years ago to commemorate Qu Yuan, a man in high-office who wished for his country’s prosperity rather than the prosperity of the royal house. However, his suggestions were always rejected by the royal class, and he was exiled as a result, and  eventually commits suicide in the Miluo River. <img id="zongzi" src=https://thewoksoflife.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/zongzi-26.jpg> As the legend goes, the local people deeply admired him, and raced out in their boats to at least find his body (this is where dragon boat racing first originated). To prevent the fish from eating Qu Yuan’s body, the locals dropped balls of sticky rice (now known as zongzi) into the river so the fish would eat that instead. Zongzi “粽子”,  is the main food eaten to celebrate this festival, and dragon boat racing, the most common activity, has become widely popular across the globe.

            <p> 5. Zhōngqiū jié <br><h2>中秋节</h2></p>
            <p class="description"> Mid-Autumn Festival: The Mid-Autumn Festival is on the 15th day of the 8th month of the Lunar Calendar, and is the second most popular festival following the New Year. The brightest and roundest moon of the whole year falls on this day. Similar to Chinese New Year, it is a time where families gather together and eat moon cakes, watch lion and dragon dances, and hang lanterns. It is a time where citizens express strong yearnings toward family members and friends who live far away (as the moon is far away from the earth).

            <p> 6. Chóngyáng jié <br><h2>重阳节</h2></p>
            <p class="description"> Chongyang Festival (Double Ninth Festival): Held on the Lunar alendar’s 9th day of the 9th month, the Double Ninth Festival is considered a lucky day. Being the largest single-digit number and sounding very similar to another character meaning everlasting, the number 9 represents longevity or eternity. Chrysanthemum wine and Chongyang cake [picture] are very popular, and goes hand in hand with going hiking and admiring the blooming chrysanthemums. It is a day to commemorate the elderly, and treat them to a day of enjoyment. <br><br>

              <h2>Forbidden City</h2>
              <p>"The Forbidden City (Chinese: 故宫; pinyin: Gùgōng) is a palace complex in central Beijing, China. It houses the Palace Museum, and was the former Chinese imperial palace from the Ming dynasty to the end of the Qing dynasty (the years 1420 to 1912). The Forbidden City served as the home of emperors and their households as well as the ceremonial and political center of Chinese government for almost 500 years.

                Constructed from 1406 to 1420, the complex consists of 980 buildings and covers 72 hectares (over 180 acres). The palace exemplifies traditional Chinese palatial architecture, and has influenced cultural and architectural developments in East Asia and elsewhere. The Forbidden City was declared a World Heritage Site in 1987, and is listed by UNESCO as the largest collection of preserved ancient wooden structures in the world.
                <img id="zongzi" src=https://3iqhm91wtiv21y4zza4dqwj2-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/China-Beijing-Forbidden-City-Two-Great-Halls-1440x961.jpg>
                Since 1925, the Forbidden City has been under the charge of the Palace Museum, whose extensive collection of artwork and artifacts were built upon the imperial collections of the Ming and Qing dynasties. Part of the museum's former collection is now in the National Palace Museum in Taipei. Both museums descend from the same institution, but were split after the Chinese Civil War. Since 2012, the Forbidden City has seen an average of 15 million visitors annually, and received more than 16 million visitors in 2016 and 2017." <br>

                <h2>The Great Wall of China <strong>(长城)</strong></h2>
                <p>"The Great Wall of China, one of the greatest wonders of the world, was listed as a World Heritage by UNESCO in 1987. Just like a gigantic dragon, it winds up and down across deserts, grasslands, mountains and plateaus, stretching approximately 21,196 kilometers from east to west of China.

                  With a history of about 2,700 years, some of the Great Wall sections are now in ruins or have disappeared. However, the Great Wall of China is still one of the most appealing attractions all around the world owing to its architectural grandeur and historical significance." <br> - from<a href=https://www.travelchinaguide.com/china_great_wall/>Travel China Guide</a><br>

                <a href = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4c_ADqshdSA>Terracotta Army: The greatest archaeological find of the 20th century - BBC News</a>
                <p>"The Terracotta Army is a collection of terracotta sculptures depicting the armies of Qin Shi Huang, the first Emperor of China. It is a form of funerary art buried with the emperor in 210–209 BCE with the purpose of protecting the emperor in his afterlife.

                  The figures, dating from approximately the late third century BCE, were discovered in 1974 by local farmers in Lintong County, outside Xi'an, Shaanxi, China. The figures vary in height according to their roles, with the tallest being the generals. The figures include warriors, chariots and horses. Estimates from 2007 were that the three pits containing the Terracotta Army held more than 8,000 soldiers, 130 chariots with 520 horses, and 150 cavalry horses, the majority of which remained buried in the pits near Qin Shi Huang's mausoleum. Other terracotta non-military figures were found in other pits, including officials, acrobats, strongmen, and musicians."<br> -from <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terracotta_Army>Wikipedia</a><br>
